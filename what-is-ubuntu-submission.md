# Ubuntu
Ubuntu is a [Linux distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution) based on Debian and composed mostly of free and open-source software.
Ubuntu is officially released in three editions: Desktop, Server, and Core for Internet of things devices and
robots. All the editions can run on the computer alone, or in a virtual machine. Ubuntu is a popular
operating system for cloud computing, with support for OpenStack. Ubuntu's default desktop has been
GNOME since version 17.10.

Ubuntu is developed by British company **Canonical**, and a community of other developers, under a
meritocratic governance model. Canonical provides security updates and support for each Ubuntu release,
starting from the release date and until the release reaches its designated **end-of-life (EOL) date**.
Canonical generates revenue through the sale of premium services related to Ubuntu and donations from
those who download the Ubuntu software. Ubuntu is named after the **Nguni philosophy** of ubuntu, which
Canonical indicates means "humanity to others" with a connotation of *"I am what I am because of who we all
are".*
